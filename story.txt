There once was a man named Dan.
Dan had one friend named Stan.
One day Dan and Stan ran,
Right into a van.
It was then, that Dan saw Fran.
Stan was shocked when Fran was tan.
And so Stan told Dan to marry Fran.

Dan was so happy he ran,
Into the arms of of a very tan Fran.
Dan yelled to Stan,
"For the wedding, let's plan!
And Stan, you will be my best man!"
